==  Welcome to the Kiji pom repository ==

This repository tracks the main parent pom files that are referenced by all
Kiji projects. These pom files are used to set plugin configurations, common
dependency versions, etc. for all Kiji projects as well as control release
management properties.

To change dependency versions, etc.:
* Make a change in kiji-root-pom/pom.xml.
* Run "mvn install" in this directory.
* Update your project's pom (e.g., kiji-schema/pom.xml) to use the
  latest SNAPSHOT version of kiji-root-pom.
* Run "mvn compile", etc. in that project.
